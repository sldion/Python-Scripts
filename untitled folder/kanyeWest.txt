I’m so happy that you guys like the music…  I’m working on the tour designs now…
Thank you to everybody who made The Life of Pablo the number 1 album in the world!!!
Tribe changed music forever
His mother’s poem at the celebration brought me to tears.
All respect prayers and love to Phife’s family    Thank you for so much inspiration
hey guys, do you like the fixed version of Wolves better?

Royère doesn't make a Polar bear bed but the Polar bear couch is my favorite piece of furniture we own https://t.co/tSJgikAUmT
and also my number one design rule of anything I do from shoes to music to homes is that Kim has to like it....
plus when you sit on the platform your calf is sort of half on half off
I love Rick Owens’ bed design but the back is too high for the beams and angle of the ceiling
I've been trying to figure out the bed design for the master bedroom at our Hidden Hills compound... https://t.co/aEPqoBGY4b

And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
We still love Kanye
That’s all it was Kanye
Man that'd be so Kanye
Called I Miss the Old Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
I even had the pink polo I thought I was Kanye
I  used to love Kanye
I used to love Kanye
And now I look and look around and there’s so many Kanyes
It wasn’t any Kanyes
See I invented Kanye
I gotta say at that time I’d like to meet Kanye
Chop up the beats Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye
Spaz in the news Kanye
The always rude Kanye
The bad mood Kanye
I hate the new Kanye
Set on his goals Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye
Straight from the Go Kanye
I miss the old Kanye

Happy Easter!
Young Thug is super inspiring to me. Amazing artist!!! https://t.co/tMh438xqJ8
I used an exclamation just to be an asshole and also to make a point! LOL
And I used a period because contrary to popular belief I strongly dislike exclamation points!
On another note, I strongly dislike suit jackets. I used the word dislike because I hate the word hate.
I love you.
I have so much love in my heart and we just need the shot to create live breathe.
I love you guys.
Everyone has made mistakes. I just make them in public.
Don't hide from the truth because it is the only light.
Don't be mad at the truth. When you don't like me you are merely shooting the messenger.
Don't be scared of the truth because we need to restart the human foundation in truth
They think we're stupid. They do not know how to communicate.
When companies doubt me they doubt us.
That dreams will actualize. Dreams will manifest.
I have a dream.
Eventually the guys with real ideas not running a scam on the world will overcome.
They can't kill us all.
I speak yell scream directly at the old guard on behalf of the future.
The Pablo pop up was almost a pop up of influence.
We are here to make life better.
And I promise the power is in the people and I will use the power given by the people to bring everything I have back to the people.
I speak truth to power!!!
I represent the dreamers.
in the past the press/old guard and powers that be would have silenced me a long time ago but I have a form of social immunity.
thank God for paps thank God for social media
We will find freedom in truth as opposed to ridicule.
We no longer have to be scared of the truth
We will breathe clean air and exercise the first amendment.
We will not get bullied by perception any longer. We will give our opinions.
We will change that. We will rise.  We will have a voice.
In Roman times the artist would contemplate proportions and colors. Now there is only one important color... Green
Let's fight for our future. We can change everything.
I stand with the utmost humility. We are so blessed!!! All praises and blessings to the families of people who never gave up on dreams
I promise I will never let the people down. I want a better life for all!!! Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo!
This is the people the culture the dreams the future.
but there is no other brand that could sell 1 million dollars of clothing in 2 days from 1 location!!!
they called me crazy and pointed fingers
Pablo in blood.
every red print is our blood our debt our shame our struggle our pain our heart ache.
Pablo in blood

Utah has eliminated homelessness by 91%
Non artist trying to grab the paint brush...
My tweets are a form of contemporary art only compromised by people trying to tell me what to tweet and not to tweet...
no one can ask me or try to tell me what to Instagram... It's my art...
on another note... I was thinking about getting an Instagram but only on one condition......
%1000 Steve Ballmer. Let's meet this week if you have time. I was hanging with Chris Paul last night.
Steve Ballmer can I please redesign the Clippers mascot
I believe in us
I think human beings can create a Utopia.
I care about quality
I care about truth.
I care about our future.
I care about people.
everyone can say anything they want about me but they could never say that I didn't care.
I have discovered my single greatest quality.  I care.
What do you mean by @JustinBieber was my favorite song of 2015

My whole family loves you and your family and we appreciate the moment you helped realize on the Beams!!!
I love you. My dad loves you.
Thank you Kirk for standing by me through all the noise.
The choir arrangement that Kirk orchestrated is the most powerful thing I've heard in my earthly existence.
A lot of people tell me Ultralight Beam is my greatest artwork to date only rival being Jesus Walks.
Be strong today little bro!  “Come to me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest. MATTHEW 11:28”
I just received a blessing from minister Kirk Franklin
Olivier designed clothes for my show… That was real,   that was groundbreaking,  that is a Real Friend.
Be real…
Don’t try to use me for advertisement or to make your proposed trend relevant.
If you wouldn’t invite me to your house then don’t invite me to your show.
Fake Fake Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake … just my analysis
So many people turned on her when she was fired and acted like they forgot the innovation and beauty that she brought to the world…
The fashion world is sooooooo fake and Carine is one of the very few real people in fashion…
I like T-shirts and women in yoga pants… I live in LA that’s what people wear… not sure why someone would put a suit jacket on with that.
All these journalists can give their opinions well these are mine…yes I believe in my ripped homeless sweaters!!!
Sorry I couldn’t be at Virgil’s show because I had a meeting in another city.
this is my friend and we've bounced ideas and references for years since the time when he designed for YEEZY Season 1.
I thank Demna for using the "I feel like Pablo" sweatshirts in his show,
I thank Olivier for designing his collection around my wife… this is visionary as I believe that Kim is our modern day everything.
Oh and I only came to Paris fashion to stand by my friends Olivier, Riccardo and Demna.
Just cause somebody is wearing combat boots doesn’t mean it’s all of a sudden youth.
I also hate all the stylists that copy Hedi Slimane and give their clients blatant YSL looks thinking that it will bring a younger client.
I feel we are so stuck in the past and tradition.
I especially hate suit jackets on women… that was a groundbreaking idea 5 million years ago!
I don’t personally like suit jackets anymore.
excited to see my family and finish the final mixes of the Life of Pablo and keep working on Turbo Grafx 16 and Season 4 ….
I’m on a plane coming back from Europe…
Get Top on the phoooone!!!!!  @Kendricklamar
we win
the pure of heart win…
the thinkers win…
the artists win...
the future thinkers win…
Together we stand… we win…
Thank you to @asvpxrocky for supporting me at the MSG show…
I guess in a media world where you never hear the truth, the truth can come off as crazy…
It’s been a lot of confusion in the past 3 weeks so let me apologize for in any way being confusing…
. @Adidas is making a million Yeezys this year, opening up new factories…
Feeling like Robin Hood…
what war?  a class war… a war against time…
sometimes the quiet moments feel like I’m home from battle…
can’t wait to get home to North, Saint and my wife…
Met with @Hermes_Paris family yesterday… been out here fighting for 13 years and it feels like we’re finally seeing wins…
Was speaking with @souljaian earlier about a new idea…
So proud of my brother @VirgilAbloh with his new @OffWht collection!!!
bear with me guys, Rome wasn’t built in a day but I promise to keep my promises…
really happy to get the quality of the products better at half the prices of last year…
Sitting with @Robinnowicki from @ustwo working on the YEEZY site…
playing the new Kendrick…  1 thousand images on the desktop…  Hennessy &amp; what’s left of the ice and coke zero…
Super inspired by my visit to Ikea today , really amazing company… my mind is racing with the possibilities…
Up late designing in Sweden…
please see these next tweets as such because the ideas will jump around a bit… a bit like a mood board...
this is a stream of consciousness… twitter poetry…
Thank you Carine for believing in the vision, You are a visionary https://t.co/f13xrRC5W9

###hashtag all positive vibes
please avoid trying to talk me out of being me in the future
Growing and learning but not being told to stop ...not being stunted.
I want people to be the best version of themselves and I will be the best version of me.
question... Why do people not want me to be me?
uuuuuuum, so there it is... No more CDs from me
the Yeezus album packaging was an open casket to CDs r.i.p
I was thinking about not making CDs ever again... Only streaming
Uuuuum... hi everybody!

I want to stream you performing in a Minnie Mouse head on @TIDALHiFi
I’m very detailed oriented and I will know the difference so don’t try to just throw a bow on the original head…
I need you to perform at her party with specifically a minnie mouse dead-mow-five head… not a mickey mouse dead-mow-five head.
can you please bring the minnie mouse head … not yours   she specifically likes minnie mouse …
Do you do birthday parties?? My daughter loves Minnie mouse…
# I’m bored  ### when you get married will your wife have a giant minnie mouse head? # This brightened up my day… thank you dead-mow-five
# hash tag you raised Tidal’s subscriptions by a whopping 🐭🐭🐭downloads
# ok another super serious question   ...  is there a portable fan situation?
# whose job is it to carry the head on the plane # hash tag #  do you check the mickey mouse head or carry on #  does it get  hot?
# ok very serious question…
@Deadmau5 … is this person’s name pronounced dead-mow-five?

Finally!!! Our guy!!! We're so so happy for Leo!!!
It is so inspiring.  Thank you for existing!
and also let’s shout out to the art direction … candy on the screens!
I just want to thank Will Ferrell for the years of joy he has brought into my life with amazing comedy
We all know Will Ferrell has always been the one!!!
that showed how sharp and Bruce Lee status he is.
Perhaps it was seeing him play the same character from 15 years ago with 15 more years experience
His existence is a blessing.
